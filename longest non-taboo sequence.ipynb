      "/tmp/austen-emma.txt: be affixed to it . do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . if he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while i was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . do not let us be too solemn on the business . he has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade . '' `` oh ! no -- i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it . do as you please . '' mr. woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of `` well , my dears , how does your book go on ? -- have you got any thing fresh ? '' `` yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . a piece of paper was found on the table this morning -- ( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy ) -- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in . '' she read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . `` aye , that 's very just , indeed , that 's very properly said . very true . ` woman , lovely woman . ' it is such a pretty charade , my dear , that i can easily guess what fairy brought it. -- nobody could have written so prettily , but you , emma . '' emma only nodded , and smiled. -- after a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , '' ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! if i had but her memory ! but i can remember nothing ; -- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; i can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several . kitty , a fair but frozen maid , kindled a flame i yet deplore , the hood-wink 'd boy i called to aid , though of his near approach afraid , so fatal to my suit before . and that is all that i can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . but i think , my dear , you said you had got it . '' `` yes , papa , it is written out in our second page . we copied it from the elegant extracts . it was garrick 's , you know . '' `` aye , very true. -- i wish i could recollect more of it . kitty , a fair but frozen maid . the name makes me think of poor isabella ; for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama . i hope we shall have her here next week . have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ? '' `` oh ! yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ; -- and there is the nursery for the children , -- just as usual , you know . why should there be any change ? '' `` i do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here ! -- not since last easter , and then only for a few days. -- mr . john knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient. -- poor isabella ! -- she is sadly taken away from us all ! -- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see miss taylor here ! '' `` she will not be surprized , papa , at least . '' `` i do not know , my dear . i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married . '' `` we must ask mr. and mrs. weston to dine with us , while isabella is here . '' `` yes , my dear , if there is time. -- but -- ( in a very depressed tone ) -- she is coming for only one week . there will not be time for any thing . '' `` it is unfortunate that they can not stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity . mr. john knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey . mr. knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us . '' `` it would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield . '' mr. woodhouse could never allow for mr. knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on isabella , except his own . he sat musing a little while , and then said , '' but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . i think , emma , i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . she and the children\n"
